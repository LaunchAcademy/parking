  As a parker
  I want to register my spot with my name
  So that the parking company can identify my car
} do
  # Acceptance Criteria:

  # * I must specify a first name, last name, email, and parking spot number
  # * I must enter a valid parking spot number (the lot has spots identified as numbers 1-60)
  # * I must enter a valid email
  # * If I specify a parking spot that has already been checked in for the day, I am told I can't check in there.
  # * If I specify a spot that hasn't yet been parked in today, I am able to check in.

  # Also covers:
  # As a parker
  # I cannot check in to a spot that has already been checked in
  # So that two cars are not parked in the same spot
